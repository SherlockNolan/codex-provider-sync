# AI / Agent Operator Guide

This file is for AI assistants and automation working in this repository. User-facing setup and usage belong in [README.md](README.md) and `docs/`.

## vNext architecture baseline

Read [Current Node Core architecture and invariants](docs/architecture/NODE_CORE_ARCHITECTURE_ZH.md) first for V1 development, then the [vNext Electron + Node architecture](docs/VNEXT_ELECTRON_NODE_ARCHITECTURE_ZH.md) for the overall target and staged migration. The current guide maps real modules, the CLI compatibility exception, and Provider I/O invariants PIO-1 through PIO-6.

The current Core guide maps the V1 implementation and accepted invariants; the larger vNext baseline also contains target-state and historical migration sections. Do not treat a target as shipped evidence or a superseded contract as the current behavior. Do not delete the .NET implementation, break the CLI/Web contract, or perform a big-bang rewrite ahead of those gates.

Phase 0 decisions and frozen behavior are indexed in the [vNext migration execution index](docs/migration/VNEXT_MIGRATION_EXECUTION_INDEX_ZH.md). Before changing an external behavior, read the applicable [Core behavior contract](docs/architecture/contracts/CORE_EXTERNAL_BEHAVIOR_ZH.md), [CLI contract](docs/architecture/contracts/CLI_CONTRACT_ZH.md), [error-code contract](docs/architecture/contracts/ERROR_CODES_ZH.md), and [behavior fixture catalog](docs/migration/BEHAVIOR_FIXTURES_ZH.md), plus the Accepted ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

An external behavior change must update its contract and add or update a fixture/test in the same PR. Target-state text is not proof that a feature exists: keep current behavior, transitional adapter behavior, and the vNext target explicitly separated.

## Goal

Help reuse Codex sessions affected by `model_provider` metadata mismatches by keeping rollout metadata and the resolved SQLite thread index aligned. This does not guarantee cross-provider continuation or compaction. Do not treat this as an authentication or account-management tool.

## Choose the interface

- Prefer the Windows Electron desktop app for users who want a double-click tool and do not want Node.js.
- Prefer the Local Web UI for browser-based or cross-platform use: `codex-provider web`.
- Use the CLI for explicit command requests, automation, diagnostics, WSL paths, or when a GUI is unavailable.
- Use `CodexProviderSync.Automation.exe` only for repository development or explicit Automation work. It ships with the v0.4 Windows Release, but protocol 0.4 is experimental and is not a stable public API or a production GUI control port.

## Safe operating flow

1. Inspect with the UI status action or `codex-provider status`.
2. Confirm the current Provider, effective SQLite Home/database, and rollout/SQLite Provider distributions.
3. Choose `sync`, `switch`, or `restore` from the rules below.
4. Execute once; do not manually edit rollout files or SQLite when the tool can perform the operation.
5. Report the final Provider alignment, backup location, and any skipped or blocked data.

## Choose the operation

- `sync`: the user already changed Provider/account with CCSwitch or another tool, and `config.toml` already contains the intended root `model_provider`.
- `switch <provider-id>`: the user explicitly wants this tool to change the root Provider and synchronize history. Custom providers must already exist in `config.toml`; built-in `openai` is always valid.
- `switch <provider-id> --keep-root-model`: preserve the root `model`.
- `switch <provider-id> --model <name>`: explicitly set the root `model`.
- `restore <backup-dir>`: roll back a mistaken operation. Cross-SQLite-Home restore requires an explicit target, relocation confirmation, and no config restore.
- `prune-backups --keep <n>`: remove only older managed backups.
- `diagnostics`: explicitly requested full read-only scan; never run automatically after status or sync.
- `repair`: explicitly selected non-Provider metadata repair; not part of sync or switch.

`sync` uses the current root `model_provider`, falling back to `openai` when it is absent. Sync and switch create an UndoBackup for actual write targets before mutation and prune only tool-managed backups (default retention: 2). A noop does not create a backup. Direct Sync still prepares and consumes a plan internally; the button click authorizes execution without a second confirmation dialog.

## Storage and path rules

Resolve SQLite Home in this order:

1. explicit CLI, desktop GUI, or Web profile override
2. root `sqlite_home` in `config.toml`
3. `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`
4. `<Codex Home>/sqlite`

Only the default layout may fall back to legacy `<Codex Home>/state_5.sqlite`. A missing explicit, config, or environment SQLite Home is an error; never silently fall back elsewhere.

On Windows, `\\wsl.localhost\...` and `\\wsl$\...` SQLite Homes are diagnostic-only. Run SQLite operations inside the matching WSL distribution, using Linux paths. Metadata v2 backups record `sqliteHome` and `sqliteDbFiles`; do not bypass relocation checks.

## Safety boundaries

- Never read, copy, log, or modify `auth.json`, credentials, or tokens. Message display/content search requires explicit History interaction in Web/Desktop. Explicit Diagnostics and selected Repair may scan only the data required by their contract; never put bodies into logs, diagnostics exports, list DTOs or persistent caches. Provider Sync does not parse bodies; its unequal-length path may stream-copy unchanged tail bytes.
- Do not change thread `updated_at` or reorder history to force visibility.
- Preserve Home locking, backup-first, native SQLite transactions, WSL and path boundaries. Ordinary Sync/Switch/Repair use retryable partial outcomes after mutation, not cross-file journals or automatic full rollback. Restore alone retains its durable recovery journal and compensation. Do not reintroduce a Node State DB resource lock.
- Rollout/SQLite counts may differ briefly because of an active session; Provider distributions are the alignment signal.
- Metadata synchronization only addresses Provider alignment, not every cause of an unusable session. Another Provider/account may be unable to decrypt existing `encrypted_content`; advise the user to return to the original Provider/account or start a new session if continuation or compact fails.
- Tests and reproduction scripts must use temporary directories or fixtures, never a real user Codex Home.

## Handle common outcomes

- SQLite busy during preflight: stop before mutation. A later transaction can still become busy; after mutation report partial with backup and retry guidance, never falsely claim zero writes or full rollback.
- Skipped locked rollout files: classify as partial success. List the skipped files and recommend another sync after the active session ends.
- Missing custom Provider: define it in `config.toml` or switch with the user's normal Provider tool, then run `sync`.
- Missing explicit SQLite database: keep the explicit path authoritative and report the error; do not use the legacy database.
- WSL UNC diagnostic: run the CLI in WSL with the Windows Codex Home under `/mnt/<drive>/...` and a Linux SQLite Home such as `/home/...`.

## Current implementation and migration direction

- The V1 Web `/api/core` entry and Electron Utility call CoreFacade; CLI and retained legacy Web write routes use `src/public-api.js` / service adapters into the same `packages/core/src/application` use cases. Do not describe every HTTP route as Facade-backed or expand the transitional adapter into another public API.
- Switch and Watch call internal ProviderSync, never CoreFacade. Storage ports do not call business use cases. Main/Renderer must not implement SQL or rollout algorithms.
- Mature storage algorithms remain in root `src/`, statically wired by Core infrastructure. Moving folders is not permission to rewrite high-risk JavaScript or duplicate it.
- V1 Electron is the primary desktop interface in this branch. .NET Windows/macOS remain Legacy fallback implementations with their own supported behavior; preserve their build, do not port new Node business capabilities back into them. Public release and phase completion still require their independent gates.
- Legacy Windows uses Application/controllers; Legacy macOS calls .NET Core directly. Do not claim both use an Application layer.

## Codex PR review policy

**Codex 审查仅 P0 阻断，不做反复审查。**

- Do not proactively request complex Codex reviews, repeated independent reviews, or review-fix-review loops. Inspect reviews already present on the current PR once before merging.
- Only a verified P0 finding from a Codex PR review blocks merge or release. Fix that finding and run the checks relevant to the fix; do not trigger another full Codex review by default.
- P1/P2/P3 findings and advisory suggestions do not block delivery or require repeated modifications. Record relevant follow-up items without expanding the approved scope.
- This policy governs Codex review overhead. Required local checks, CI, release-container acceptance, and explicit publication authorization still apply; never weaken those gates to satisfy a review preference.

## Mandatory Provider I/O regression gate

- Follow PIO-1 through PIO-6 in the current Core guide. Sync reads bounded first-line metadata, not full chat streams. No public `sync --provider`, `--fast` or `syncMode`.
- Eligible equal-byte-length JSON Provider literals must use the existing in-place descriptor/handle path. Preserve file identity, size and body hash; character-count equality alone is insufficient. Do not fall back to whole-file replacement after an in-place failure.
- Ineligible but valid headers use streaming tail copy and atomic replacement with byte-identical bodies. Invalid/changed/locked targets must not be forcibly rewritten.
- Run `npm run architecture:check` and `npm test` for Core changes; platform skips and failures must be reported. The first command reuses workspace boundary checks and Provider I/O tests, not a second rule engine.
- Behavior changes require an explicit ADR/contract/fixture update and matching user docs. Do not weaken an invariant test to bless accidental drift. README is not a substitute for the current Core guide.

## Mandatory local preflight and release flow

Follow this order: **local preflight passes → CI cross-platform and real installation acceptance passes → publish with explicit authorization**. See [Windows release procedure](docs/WINDOWS_ELECTRON_RELEASE_ZH.md) for commands and evidence requirements.

- Before pushing, review all affected contracts, test expectations and build modes together, then run the relevant local tests. Do not use Actions as the first check for failures reproducible locally. Report unavailable local checks explicitly and leave them to the matching CI environment.
- Desktop changes require relevant production-bundle checks, not just development-mode tests. Update changes must cover both portable/manual and authorized installed-updater modes; derive expectations from the intended channel/container, never from the application's returned value.
- Reuse an existing build for repeated local checks only when its product sources, dependencies, build configuration and version are unchanged. Test-script or documentation-only edits do not require another local package build. Record the build provenance; an old local package is not release evidence for a new SHA.
- Use isolated fixtures under D-drive temporary directories on this Windows workstation; keep desktop tests hidden or on a secondary monitor. Never test against a real Codex Home. An installed-layout fixture is not proof of real installation or upgrade; run actual installer/uninstaller tests in an isolated environment, since a custom installation directory may still affect the user's registered app.
- CI must validate the final source SHA on the required platforms and exercise real release containers, including installation/extraction, startup, SQLite loading, fixture Sync → Restore, graceful exit and applicable uninstall cleanup. All applicable gates must pass before publication; local success does not replace them.
- Diagnose failed jobs before rerunning. For a verified transient failure on unchanged code, rerun only failed jobs and reuse successful same-run/same-SHA artifacts where the release procedure permits. Do not repeatedly rebuild everything, weaken assertions or increase timeouts merely to obtain a green run.
- Publish only artifacts tied to the accepted final SHA, version and build configuration, with verified hashes. Product/build changes require rebuilding affected artifacts and rerunning affected acceptance checks. Preserve the required final-SHA gates even when reducing redundant local builds.

## Reporting

State the current Provider, whether rollout and SQLite metadata are aligned, the resolved database path, the backup created by a write operation, and whether the result was complete, partial, or blocked. Distinguish automated tests from real-machine validation and list anything not run.

For CLI-only history migration, use `codex-provider export [archive-path]` on the source device and `codex-provider import <archive-path>` on the destination. `export --select` browses and chooses conversations; `--ids` supports scripted selection. Imports merge incrementally and resolve thread ID conflicts with `--conflict ask|skip|overwrite|fail`. Archives do not include authentication or Provider configuration.
