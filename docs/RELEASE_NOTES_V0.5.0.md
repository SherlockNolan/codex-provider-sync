# v0.5.0 Technical Release Notes

This is the npm release for the CLI and Local Web UI. The Windows GUI uses an independent GitHub Release channel and may have a different version; no v0.5.0 Windows GUI Release was created.

v0.5.0 hardens the localhost Web UI shipped through PR #80. The browser now pairs through a high-entropy, short-lived, single-use URL fragment and receives a persistent device credential. The service persists only credential hashes and resolves all operational storage paths from server-managed profiles.

The HTTP listener remains restricted to `127.0.0.1`. Browser writes require a paired device credential and an Origin matching the request's actual loopback Host and port, including `localhost`, custom ports, and SSH-forwarded ports. The service is not intended for LAN or public exposure.

History search now waits 300ms after typing, searches immediately on Enter, aborts superseded list/detail requests, and allows only the latest response to update the view. No SQLite or full-text History index is introduced.

The supported runtime floor is Node.js 16.20.2. CI covers 16.20.2 and the current LTS, including dependency installation, Web build, and the full Node test suite. The npm package and repository .NET project versions are 0.5.0.

Validation covers anonymous-page isolation, device authorization, one-time pairing, credential persistence/reset, dynamic loopback Origin checks, loopback-only binding, server-managed profiles, request supersession, Web build, Node tests, and release-version consistency.
